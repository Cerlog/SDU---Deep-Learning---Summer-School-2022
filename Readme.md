Course Description

Machine learning has become a part in our everydays life, from simple product recommendations to personal electronic assistant to self-driving cars. More recently, through the advent of potent hardware and cheap computational power, “Deep Learning” has become a popular and powerful tool for learning from complex, large-scale data.

In this course, we will discuss the fundamentals of deep learning and its application to various different fields. We will learn about the power but also the limitations of these deep neural networks. At the end of the course, the students will have significant familiarity with the subject and will be able to apply the learned techniques to a broad range of different fields.

Mainly, the course will cover practical as well theoretical aspects of the Deep Learning and also gives a broad general introduction to machine learning and statistical learning in general.

Materials

The students should bring:

You only need a laptop with a 64 Bit CPU and Python 3+ running
We will form teams and work on the practical parts of the course together, so even if your laptop is very old you can easily participate within a group
Reading Material (please note that the books cover the stuff in more detail than needed for the course):

All lecture slides will be uploaded before the lecture.
The Deep Learning Book (Part I & Part II) (short: DLB)
An Introduction to Statistical Learning (Chapters 1-3) (short: ITSL)
